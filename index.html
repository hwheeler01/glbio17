<p>Advances in computing have created a data-driven revolution in biology and promises to guide the development of precision medicine. This special session will bring together scientists from biology and computer science to explore emerging topics in personalized medicine. This session is timely given the new <a href="https://www.nih.gov/precision-medicine-initiative-cohort-program">Precision Medicine Initiative</a> by the NIH. It will consist of two exciting sub-sessions. The first sub-session will explore genomics research in underserved human populations and sex differences in complex traits. The second session will highlight the broad spectrum of challenges and opportunities in precision medicine, including translational genomics, electronic health record (EHR) analytics, and drug discovery.</p>

<p>Genomic studies that focus on potential population and sex differences are crucial to ensure the community does not contribute to healthcare disparities. How the genetic architectures of complex traits vary between populations is not well understood, in part due to the <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/genomics-is-failing-on-diversity-1.20759?WT.mc_id=TWT_NatureNews">historical paucity</a> of genome-wide association studies in populations of non-European ancestry. The genetic contribution to population phenotypic differentiation is driven by differences in causal allele frequencies, effect sizes, and genetic architectures. Such differences will affect predictive power and need to be systematically characterized. In addition, despite the <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/policy-nih-to-balance-sex-in-cell-and-animal-studies-1.15195">critical importance of biological sex</a> in all areas of development and disease, relatively few attempts have been made to address the complexity of sexual dimorphism in genetic studies of disease and pharmacogenomics phenotypes. In this sub-session, we will highlight the work of those performing genomics research in underserved populations and/or exploring the sex differences/similarities underlying complex traits.

<p>Translating the massive amounts of genomic and medical data available into concrete strategies for precision medicine remains a difficult task.  Here, we consider some of the key challenges and opportunities in realizing the promise of precision medicine.  </p>
<p>In this afternoon sub-session, faculty from the <a href="http://www.ttic.edu">Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago</a> have assembled a series of talks to explore the spectrum of challenges in precision medicine, including: How can we identify the optimal treatments for cancer patients? Why do certain treatments work for some patients but do not work for others?  What can we learn from antibiotic resistance and off-targeting of drugs? What types of information can be effectively mined in electronic health records? </p>
<p>Current speakers:<br>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.tempus.com/about-us/">Kevin White</a> - President, Tempus Labs (and the University of Chicago)</li>
<li><a href="http://ttic.uchicago.edu/~aakhan/">Aly Khan</a> - Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago</li>
<li><a href="http://www.ttic.edu/naveed.php">Hammad Naveed</a> - Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago</li>
<li>Additional Short Talks Chosen from Abstracts</li>
</ul>

We invite abstracts for oral presentation on the following topic areas: (1) translational genomics, (2) electronic health record analytics, and (3) drug discovery.
